# movie-recc
This is a simple movie recommender made by using tmdb_500: movies,credits data sets. 
It basically suggests you movies you would like after seeing your intrests and tonality by taking certain parameters such as Genres,actors,overviews;etc.
took me three steps to make it:
1. getting the data sets and preprocessig (changing the data into lists)
2. modelling the data to make it usable
3. merging and providing suitable results for combined recommenedations
